### Steps to Create a Generative Language Model with Markov Chains:
1. Data Collection: To kickstart the process, gather a substantial corpus of text data that will lay the groundwork for your language model. This corpus can span a wide array of sources, ranging from books to articles and other textual references.
   
2. Preprocessing: Before diving into model construction, it is imperative to meticulously preprocess the text data. This preprocessing phase includes tasks such as eliminating punctuation, converting text to lowercase, managing special characters, and segmenting the text into tokens, be it words or characters.
   
3. Building the Markov Chain: Moving on to the creation of the Markov Chain itself, this step involves delving into the sequential connections among tokens in the text dataset. Create a dictionary where each token acts as a key, with its potential subsequent tokens serving as values accompanied by their corresponding probabilities.
   
4. Generating Text: Harness the power of the Markov Chain to generate fresh textual content. Begin the text generation process by selecting an initial token and subsequently making informed decisions on the next token, guided by the transition probabilities stored within the chain. Iterate through this procedure to craft text of the desired length, leveraging the effectiveness of probabilistic selection.
